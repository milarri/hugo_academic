abstract: Corbicula fluminea is a widespread and problematic invasive bivalve
  species in many freshwater ecosystems. Here, a systematic literature review
  was performed to synthesise what is presently known about C. fluminea in
  relation to its biology, ecology, and management. Of the total 1156 studies
  analysed, most were conducted in North America and Europe, with a primary
  focus on toxicology and ecology. In the native range, most studies assessed
  the role of C. fluminea in human nutrition and health. We have also identified
  a series of knowledge gaps that should be considered by future research. These
  include, for example, the need to better assess basic biological and
  ecological features (e.g. distribution, abundance, biomass, population
  structure, modes of reproduction, natural enemies) of C. fluminea, while the
  resolution of severe taxonomic problems that persist within the Corbicula
  species complex should be addressed with novel molecular tools. Further,
  better understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the impacts of C.
  fluminea in the invaded range is required. Given the high invasiveness of C.
  fluminea, novel methodologies and techniques to improve early detection,
  prediction of spread, and effective management for successful containment and
  eradication are urgently needed.
