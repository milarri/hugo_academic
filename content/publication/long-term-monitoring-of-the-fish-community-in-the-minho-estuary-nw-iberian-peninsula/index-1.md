  The paper presents an extensive fish sampling dataset spanning a long-term
  period from

  2010 to 2019. The data were collected in Lenta Marina, an upstream area in the Minho

  Estuary of the NW Iberian Peninsula, which belongs to a LTSER (Long-Term Socio-

  Ecological Research) platform. To capture fish, fyke nets were utilised as the sampling

  method and deployed at Lenta Marina. This dataset offers valuable insights into the

  abundance of each collected taxa recorded over time.
