abstract: Corbicula fluminea is one of the most widespread invasive species in
  aquatic ecosystems. Originating from Southeast Asia this clam has been
  dispersing worldwide over the last decades (Darrigran 2002; McMahon 2002;
  Sousa et al. 2008b). Corbicula fluminea was first reported in the Minho
  estuary in 1989 (Araujo et al. 1993), and is now a major component of the
  benthic fauna in terms of density and biomass, contributing to more than 95%
  of the overall biomass (Sousa et al. 2008e). Recently, the C. fluminea
  population has been undergoing rapid die-offs in the Minho estuary, due to
  extreme abiotic changes that have been occurring in the summer (e.g. low river
  flow, high temperature, low dissolved oxygen and lower redox potential). The
  first documented event occurred in the summer 2005, and was associated with a
  strong heatwave. The major declines in C. fluminea density and biomass
  occurred in estuarine areas with fine sediments and rich in organic matter
  content (Sousa et al. 2008a, d). Environmental impacts resulted from the 2005
  heatwave and the synergistic effects caused by the great mortalities of C.
  fluminea were responsible for dramatic changes in the macrozoobenthic
  estuarine community (Sousa et al. 2008c), with the native bivalve populations
  (e.g. Pisidium amnicum, Unio pictorum, Anodonta anatina and Psilunio
  littoralis) being severely affected. However, C. fluminea rapidly recovered
  from this impact, returning in the subsequent years to the earlier density and
  biomass (Sousa et al. 2008c). In September 2009, local fisherman reported
  massive accumulations of soft putrefying parts of this Asian clam at the water
  surface, suggesting another massive die-off. Given the ecological importance
  of this phenomenon, and since a long data set concerning the ecology of C.
  fluminea in this estuary already exists (Sousa et al. 2008a, d), the aims of
  the present study were to report the first results of the recent massive
  mortality of C. fluminea in the Minho estuary, and also to discuss the
  ecological changes resulting from this occurrence.
