abstract: Knowledge on population dynamics of ecosystem's key-species is
  invaluable to understand how populations will respond to natural and
  human-induced perturbations. The amphipod Echinogammarus marinus is a
  key-species from European estuarine habitats with a distribution ranging from
  Norway to Portugal [1]. The present article contains supportive data related
  to a research article entitled ‘Comparing production and life-history traits
  of a key amphipod species within and between estuaries under different levels
  of anthropogenic pressure’ [2]. The present dataset presents the density,
  biomass, fecundity, and production of E. marinus in three estuaries under
  different anthropogenic pressure and, within each estuary, at three sampling
  sites, which differed in terms of the distance to the estuary mouth,
  vegetation cover, and organic matter content. Monthly environmental abiotic
  data and seasonal concentration of PAH and other contaminants are also
  provided. Sampling took place monthly for 13 months at low tide on intertidal
  mudflats. At each site, Fucus fronds containing E. marinus individuals were
  randomly collected. All E. marinus individuals were counted, sexed, and
  measured under a binocular stereo microscope to estimate the density and the
  biomass of E. marinus in Fucus fronds. Finally, the annual production of E.
  marinus at each sampling site was estimated through the size-frequency method.
  This dataset may be used to compare population traits of E. marinus
  populations across different estuaries and it may overall assist designing
  studies regarding population dynamics and designing management strategies in
  coastal systems, namely targeting at habitat conservation and restoration.
