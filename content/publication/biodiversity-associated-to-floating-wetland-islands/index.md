abstract: Floating wetland islands (FWI) are nature-based solutions that can be
  applied in different water bodies, such lakes, ponds and rivers, considering a
  wide range of purposes. They have been considered for eutrophication
  abatement, wastewater treatment and ecosystem rehabilitation. They are of
  great value since their efficiency relies on bioremediation processes and are
  thus very versatile in terms of water depuration but also on biodiversity
  promotion. These systems comprise a floating platform, selected plants and an
  anchoring system. Depending on their configuration, they will attract and
  harbor different organisms such macrofauna and microorganisms, that will use
  the platform as shelter, habitat, stepping stone, nursery, food source among
  other benefits. The plant species are of particular interest since they are
  the living interface between the platform and the water body and they must be
  selected according to criteria that will enable their successful establishment
  having in consideration the biotic factors. The present paper intends to give
  an overview of the role of FWI towards their associated biodiversity and what
  has been identified in literature as the main groups that can be found and
  related to operational conditions. This approach can support future decisions
  concerning the FWI implementation conditions and components towards
  biodiversity enhancement.
