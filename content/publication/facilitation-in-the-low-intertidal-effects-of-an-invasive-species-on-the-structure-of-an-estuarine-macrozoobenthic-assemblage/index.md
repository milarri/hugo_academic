abstract: "The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774) has been recognized
  as one of the most important invasive alien species in aquatic ecosystems and
  may have significant ecological and economic impacts. Recently, the presence
  of C. fluminea was associated with changes in benthic and epibenthic fauna. In
  this study, we aimed to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of C.
  fluminea on an estuarine macrozoobenthic assemblage using a manipulative
  experiment. We used 5 different treatments (control, rock, closed, live,
  open), which were placed in a low sandy intertidal soft bottom area in the
  Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula) for 2 months. We found that the presence
  of live and open empty shells of C. fluminea had positive effects on the
  density, biomass and species richness of macrozoobenthos, specifically on
  species belonging to Annelida, Mollusca and Crustacea. Our results may be
  explained by 2 main mechanisms: (1) the production of feces and pseudofeces by
  C. fluminea, which increases organic matter content and food resources for
  some macrozoobenthic species; and (2) ecosystem engineering activities by C.
  fluminea, which can create conditions for the establishment of other species
  via shell production and bioturbation in the sediments."
