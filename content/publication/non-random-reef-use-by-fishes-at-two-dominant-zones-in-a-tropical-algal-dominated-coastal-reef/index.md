abstract: Habitat use and the processes which determine fish distribution were
  evaluated at the reef flat and reef crest zones of a tropical, algal-dominated
  reef. Our comparisons indicated significant differences in the majority of the
  evaluated environmental characteristics between zones. Also, significant
  differences in the abundances of twelve, from thirteen analyzed species, were
  observed within and between-sites. According to null models, non-random
  patterns of species co-occurrences were significant, suggesting that fish
  guilds in both zones were non-randomly structured. Unexpectedly, structural
  complexity negatively affected overall species richness, but had a major
  positive influence on highly site-attached species such as a damselfish. Depth
  and substrate composition, particularly macroalgae cover, were positive
  determinants for the fish assemblage structure in the studied reef, prevailing
  over factors such as structural complexity and live coral cover. Our results
  are conflicting with other studies carried out in coral-dominated reefs of the
  Caribbean and Pacific, therefore supporting the idea that the factors which
  may potentially influence reef fish composition are highly site-dependent and
  variable.
