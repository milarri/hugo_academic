abstract: This paper presents the results of the first field study of the
  Brazilian endemic damselfish Stegastes rocasensis. Underwater data were
  collected at the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (NE Brazil), where four sites
  were visually assayed for local territorial and feeding behaviors, as well as
  habitat use. S. rocasensis preferentially fed on turf and macroalgae, and
  during the afternoon period. Its territory size ranged from 0.26 to 13.86 m2
  (1.61 ± 0.23 m2). Our findings suggest that adults preferably inhabit shallow,
  turf-rich areas, while sub-adults and juveniles occupy deeper areas with
  higher percent cover of invertebrates and hard corals, respectively. With
  regards to agonistic behaviors, pursuit of intruders was the most frequent
  reaction recorded (p < 0.001); the highest level of aggression was elicited by
  territorial herbivores (p < 0.001). Nevertheless, analysis of attacks elicited
  by different fish species within S. rocasensis’ territory showed that more
  attacks were launched on conspecifics than on other fish species.
