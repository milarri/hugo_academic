abstract: Reef fish usually display a remarkable variety of colours and
  coloration patterns. The colour patterns are largely used for species
  identification, and some morphologically conservative genera are highly
  dependent on coloration for this purpose. In this context, this paper aims to
  briefly describe unusual colour patterns recorded for territorial damselfish
  of the genus Stegastes in the south-western Atlantic Ocean. Four unreported
  coloration pattern types were observed in three species (S. fuscus, S.
  rocasensis and S. pictus). The pale morph which is characterized by
  individuals presenting whitish marks over the regular coloration pattern was
  recorded in S. fuscus in north-eastern reefs and S. rocasensis in Fernando de
  Noronha archipelago. On the other hand, S. fuscus and S. pictus presented
  other types of unusual coloration patterns, which are characterized by an
  irregular cover (blue or dusky) over the regular colour pattern. Another type
  of unusual coloration pattern was recorded for S. fuscus, which presented a
  yellowish/reddish dorso-anterior band. Additionally, two distinct colour
  patterns of adult S. variabilis, from the south-eastern and north-eastern
  Brazilian reefs are reported.
