  The paper presents an extensive fish sampling dataset spanning a long-term
  period

  (weekly) from 2010 to 2019. The data was collected in Lenta Marina, an upstream area in

  the Minho Estuary of the NW Iberian Peninsula. To capture fish, fyke nets were utilized as

  the sampling method. This dataset offers valuable insights into the abundance of each

  collected taxa, recorded per date.

  The dataset reports a comprehensive compilation of fish abundance data, providing a

  detailed record of how the fish community has changed over time. The dataset clearly

  shows a trend where the amount of fish from invasive taxa exceeds the count of fish from

  native taxa.
