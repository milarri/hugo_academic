  As the effects of climate change continue to intensify, non-native species are
  becoming more

  prevalent in estuarine ecosystems. This has implications for the taxonomic and functional diversity

  of fish communities. Historically, biodiversity has been a synonym of taxonomic diversity, however

  this approach often fails to provide accurate insights on ecosystem functioning and resilience. To

  better understand how climate change is impacting fishes and their traits composition, a long-term

  dataset from Minho Estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula) fish assemblage was analyzed. The results suggest that climate change and extreme weather events are altering the prevailing trait modalities

  of fishes, which led to the overall decrease in functional diversity of the fish assemblage over the

  course of a decade. This decrease is associated to the loss of some trait modalities that are

  exclusively found in native species. On the other hand, the invasive species added novel traits

  associated to the conditions of high temperatures and low precipitation regime currently observed in the studied area. Our results highlight that the shift in the presence and dominance of some

  functional traits is directly influenced by climatic changes. Also, despite the addition of novel

  modalities by the invasive species, the fish assemblage is now less functional and taxonomic

  diverse than previously.
