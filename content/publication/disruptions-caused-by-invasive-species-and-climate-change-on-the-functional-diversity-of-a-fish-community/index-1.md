abstract: As the effects of climate change continue to intensify, non-native
  species are becoming more prevalent in estuarine ecosystems. This has
  implications for the taxonomic and functional diversity of fish communities.
  Historically, biodiversity has been a synonym of taxonomic diversity, however
  this approach often fails to provide accurate insights on ecosystem
  functioning and resilience. To better understand how climate change is
  impacting fishes and their traitsâ€™ composition, a long-term dataset from Minho
  Estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula) fish assemblage was analyzed. The results
  suggest that climate change and extreme weather events altered the prevailing
  trait modalities of fishes, which led to the overall decrease in functional
  diversity of the fish assemblage over the course of a decade. This decrease is
  associated to the loss of some trait modalities that are exclusively found in
  native species. On the other hand, the invasive species added novel traits
  associated with the conditions of high temperatures and low precipitation
  regime currently observed in the studied area. Our results highlight that the
  shift in the presence and dominance of some traits is directly influenced by
  climatic changes. Also, despite the addition of novel modalities by the
  invasive species, the fish assemblage is now less functional and taxonomically
  diverse than previously.
