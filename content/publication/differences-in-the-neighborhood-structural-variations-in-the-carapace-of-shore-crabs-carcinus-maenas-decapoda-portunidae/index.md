abstract: The present study compared the carapace structure of Carcinus maenas
  in two nearby sites (2 km apart) within Minho estuary, submitted to different
  physicochemical and ecological conditions (water temperature, pH, crabs’
  density and sex ratio). The carapace structure of the carapace and chelae of
  the crabs presented significant differences between sampling sites (t-test; p
  < 0.01). The SIMPER analysis revealed that the Weight/CW and Thickness/CW
  ratios explained all the dissimilarities found among sites. Overall, the male
  carapace was proportionally thicker at station 2 (t-test; p < 0.01), while the
  female carapace was proportionally thicker at station 1 (t-test; p < 0.001). A
  thicker carapace can be advantageous when competing for food or a sexual
  partner. We hypothetized that, since at station 2, the density of individuals
  was twice higher than at station 1, it is likely that agonistic encounters are
  more frequent, thus favouring a thicker carapace.
