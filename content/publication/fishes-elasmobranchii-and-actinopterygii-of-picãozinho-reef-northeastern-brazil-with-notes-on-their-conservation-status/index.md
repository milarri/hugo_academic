abstract: Shallow reefs on the northeastern coast of Brazil are rich, productive
  and diverse environments, with great ecological and economical importance.
  Picãozinho is located 1,500 m off the coast of João Pessoa city, Paraíba
  state, NE Brazil. The aim of this work is to provide an updated list of the
  reef fishes of Picãozinho, based on a survey of approximately 350 hours of
  direct observation using free dive techniques, and complemented by collection
  data and other unpublished records. A total of 102 species of 43 families were
  recorded. Of these, 36 are new occurrences for the reef and seven are species
  that have been recently resurrected from synonymy, mainly with Caribbean
  species previously cited for Brazil.
