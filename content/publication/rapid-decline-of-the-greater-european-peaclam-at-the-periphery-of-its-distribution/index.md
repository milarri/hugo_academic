abstract: Extirpation or even extinction of freshwater invertebrate species is a
  neglected conservation issue; declines in abundance and spatial distribution
  for freshwater invertebrates are far less documented than for vertebrate
  species. In the Minho River tidal freshwater wetlands (northwest of Iberian
  Peninsula), a rapid decline in density and biomass of the bivalve Pisidium
  amnicum was recorded at 16 different sites over seven years, from 2004 to
  2010, without any sign of a potential recovery. Mean density values reached
  more than 80 ind.m−2 in 2004, but declined to less than 1 ind.m−2 in 2009 and
  2010. An identical declining trend was observed for biomass. A significant
  reduction in the spatial distribution also occurred. The abiotic changes
  resulting from the 2005 heat wave and possibly the negative interactions
  imposed by the non-indigenous invasive bivalve Corbicula fluminea were the
  main factors responsible for the declining trends. Given the very low density,
  P. amnicum is facing a serious risk of extirpation in this ecosystem and
  conservational measures are urgently needed.
