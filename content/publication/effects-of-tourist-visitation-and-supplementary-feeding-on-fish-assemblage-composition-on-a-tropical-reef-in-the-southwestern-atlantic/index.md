abstract: "The effects of tourist visitation and food provisioning on fish
  assemblages were assessed by visual censuses (stationary technique) carried
  out in a tropical reef in Northeastern Brazil. Comparisons of species
  abundance, richness, equitability, and trophic structure in the presence (PT)
  and absence (AT) of tourists suggest that tourist visitation and supplementary
  food influenced the structure of the fish assemblage, as follows: (a)
  diversity, equitability and species richness were significantly higher on the
  AT period, while the abundance of a particular species was significantly
  higher during PT; (b) trophic structure differed between the AT and PT
  periods, omnivores being more abundant during the latter period, while mobile
  invertivores, piscivores, roving herbivores and territorial herbivores were
  significantly more abundant on AT. Reef tourism is increasingly being regarded
  as an alternative to generate income for human coastal communities in the
  tropics. Therefore, closer examination of the consequences of the various
  components of this activity to reef system is a necessary step to assist
  conservation and management initiatives."
