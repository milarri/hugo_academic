abstract: Bivalves may play a major role in structuring aquatic communities.
  This may be especially relevant in aquatic communities dominated by non-native
  invasive bivalves, which can contribute to the increase of habitat
  homogenization. In this study, we assess how habitat homogenization, through
  the reduction of empty bivalve shells identities, influences the
  macroinvertebrate assemblages. Towards this end, a manipulative experiment
  with the empty shells of two native (Potomida littoralis and Unio delphinus)
  and one non-native (Corbicula fluminea) species was performed. Seven
  treatments were prepared, three of them consisting of homogeneous substrates
  using shells of one species, and four of them consisting in heterogeneous
  substrates using more than one species. The associated fauna colonizing
  different treatments was analyzed through taxonomic and trait-based
  approaches. Our results showed that the substrate complexity influenced the
  density of macroinvertebrates, with the heterogeneous treatments significantly
  yielding more dense assemblages. Also, the trait patterns differed among the
  levels of habitat heterogeneity, influencing mainly organisms that feed on
  microphytes of both small and big sizes, that inhabit areas with slow to
  moderate water flow, and that have short and long live cycles. Further, the
  functional diversity was not influenced by the substrate heterogeneity.
  Therefore, the habitat homogenization, through the accumulation of non-native
  C. fluminea empty shells in the river bottom, did not affect the functional
  diversity of the macroinvertebrate assemblages.
