abstract: "Corbicula fluminea is a known aquatic invasive species responsible
  for several ecological and economic impacts. In Portugal, it is found in all
  major watersheds, although to varying degrees of invasion (regarding density,
  biomass and spatial distribution). The aim of this study was to evaluate the
  spatio-temporal differences in condition indices (CIs) and biochemical
  composition (proteins, lipids and energy) of individuals collected in Lima
  (low invasion) and Minho (high invasion) Rivers, as well as the effects of
  intra-specific competition (densities: 150, 500, 1000 individuals/m2) on the
  CIs of C. fluminea. CIs and biochemical composition varied between rivers and
  over time, with populations in Lima and Minho showing different patterns.
  Corbicula fluminea in Lima River had higher CIs and lower densities with more
  individuals of larger size, while individuals in Minho River had lower CIs and
  high densities with a more uniform size distribution. The intra-specific
  competition experiment showed that the optimum of C. fluminea was reached at
  500 individuals/m2 density, possibly related to the species ability of enrich
  sediments with organic matter, leading to a positive feedback on phytoplankton
  and/or microbial communities. This study improves the understanding of the
  ecophysiological conditions of C. fluminea populations, a topic neglected in
  previous studies."
