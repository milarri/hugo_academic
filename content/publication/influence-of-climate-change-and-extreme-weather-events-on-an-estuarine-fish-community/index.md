abstract: Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent as a result of
  climate change, and the increasing frequency of these events may lead to
  significant changes in fish assemblages. In this sense, this work aimed to
  study the effects of climate change and extreme weather events on fish
  assemblages in the Rio Minho estuary (Portugal). Between 2010 and 2019,
  continuous weekly sampling with fyke nets was carried out to assess the
  dynamics of fish assemblages in the estuary. In addition, temperature and
  precipitation data were obtained from satellite information to assess the
  relationship between climatic variables and fish composition, structure, and
  diversity. Fish populations changed significantly over time, becoming less
  diverse and largely dominated by a few, mostly invasive species (e.g., carp,
  goldfish, pumpkinseed, and tench), while the abundance of most native species
  declined over the years (e.g., panjorca, stickleback, and shad). High
  temperatures and low precipitation negatively affected native species, while
  the invasive species benefited from increased temperatures and extreme weather
  events (droughts and floods).
